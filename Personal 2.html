<td align= "left">  According to Cambridge Dictionary, derived from the Latin word "persona" which means "mask", it is the combination of characteristics or qualities that form an individual's distinctive character. 
I am not a stranger to these tests as I was always curious about myself. The test that I will be using is the <a href= "https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test" target= "_blank"> The Big Five Personality Test</a>. 
The Big Five Personality Test is a survey that asks you questions which would later help you to determine, based on your score, the percentage of the different Big Five Personality traits. 
These traits were based on Lewis Goldberg’s1963 lexical hypothesis. This hypothesis states that a person’s personality can be described based on Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism and Openness.

not like it as in order to be truthful you have to risk being offensive. </td>

It has improved over the years and my goal is to reach 50% by next year. I am not an impulsive person as I like to think through a lot of things that I do. 
However, I have difficulty handing in assignments on time and my time management skills are not the best. This is something that makes me discouraged from time to time but I am willing to improve myself regardless of the time and cost.

I must say that I may not be answering those questions the best as I answered them based on my recent interactions with my extroverted friends. 
I am more interactive with them as they do more of the talking.  
However I have seen where I have gotten less introverted as I have been more assertive with my advances and I have been speaking up for myself when necessary. 
I have improved in how my energy is feeling more energized with the interactions with others.

I am not as forgiving however and that can be hurtful to my personal relationships.

I have healed so much from a lot of things that I have not been as anxious and depressed as I once was. 
I am figuring out how to manage my stressors and triggers with the specific remedies necessary. 
What helped this was a shift in mindset, and confronting things head on. There are other things but the most important one is understanding that I am a human being first and as much as I need to hold myself accountable, 
I also need to give myself grace and deal with consequences, learning not to do them again. 
Patience is definitely key. </td>
