In this era of social media, it seems like we are always trying to be the best of ourselves, or at least trying to look like the best version of ourselves in hopes of being that one day.  
We sometimes compare ourselves to one another, forgetting our strengths and magnifying our weaknesses. These are three of my strengths that I have so far. </h2>     </td>

	<td> I actively try to get myself out of my head and focus on what the other person is saying. I find that asking follow up questions and reiterating what the person recently said to get the information correct, help a lot in these situations. 
Coming in the conversation to learn and not to prove a point also helps as you are more receptive to the other person’s perspective. I also find that when you approach a conversation through learning, you tend to be more at ease. 
If you are more introverted like me, You can start by having a relaxed posture while holding eye contact. When you project a safe and relaxed attitude people will think that you are dependable and may even make you look more confident thus making them feel safe to come to you for your advice and counsel. 
This might take time but after a while it will get better but you have to start. It helps if you have accountability partners. </td>

	<td> Looking back on my day and seeing what went right and what went wrong is a good way of correcting behaviour and regulating emotions. You can start by having a moment of silence to see where you are and what thoughts come to mind. 
You will recognize that many thoughts will run through your mind and it varies from moment to moment. Sometimes it is when we stop we realize how we feel about certain things and see where we are going in different aspects of our lives. 
This, however, requires a lot of honesty on your part and if you have an accountability partner that will make it easier. Four starters, you can try journaling your thoughts as small as it is. Also listening more when people talk helps as you start to actively problem solve and ask questions to the other person. 
The important thing is to start.</td>

	<td> Even though I struggle with forgiveness, I find that I have high levels of empathy. I can see what another person is going through and understand them well, even if I didn't go through what they were going through.
 I often ask myself the following questions, “What would I do if I was in that situation?” or “How would I react if I was in that situation?” And if I want some understanding I would what would cause them to behave the way they are acting. 
At the end of the day, it is about others as sometimes our reactions are the things that save us and not our intellect or logic, as much as those things are equally as important. Humans are emotional beings first and we behave based on our environments, triggers and culture. 
Understanding this can help you to start being more empathic. This doesn't mean that you shouldn’t have boundaries and allow people to disrespect you. But having an empathic attitude can cause you to have less stress and allow you to have better interactions with others. </td>

Time is needed to show for the things we work towards as these things that we hope for don't show overnight but over a period of time. 
Effort is needed as things and people are hard and it takes consistency and intentionality. 
Imagination is for how you see yourself and what you could be. It is for the possibility of you, your family, your friends and your community.  You must maintain your space like a garden as you need to put in
the effort to ensure the crops and plants flourish, time as crops are harvested and flowers bloom over a period of time and imagine the potential of the things so you can work towards them with hope. </td>

You need to change the direction of your life as in, you need to make small changes for your future. You might not be able to change the destination overnight, but you can change to a direction which would ultimately change the  destination.
Set the goal and work backwards. Break it down into small pieces, work towards it until you attain your desired result. Many opportunities are in a day but only one is the best one and that is the one that aligns with your goal. </td>

You want to live a life that is filled with accomplishment and not with regret. So contend with your hurdles and mishaps until you achieve your goal. Time management is very important as you don't want to tie yourself to your job. 
Spending their time on the urgent and not on the important so you need to be a master of time and not the other way around. </td>

<td> In Chapter 6 we then talk about surrounding yourself with the best people. 
Your company can tell a lot about you and your goals. 
You need to ask the question, what impact does my friends have on me? 
Do you feel motivated to start that business plan or do you feel like the world is against you all the time? 
You have to categorize the people you are around by: Disassociation, Limited Association and Expanded Association.
Disassociation is when you cut people off completely and don't see them again. 
I know it is hard to let go of people who you have known for a long time but not everyone is meant to be with you to the end. 
Limited Association is when you have people in your life when they are valuable to you and you care about them but it is better to love them from a distance. 
Expanded Association is who you spend the majority of your time with as they are the ones that build you up. 
Doing this will prevent people from contaminating your space. 
But all of this starts with you, your attitude, your outlook, you mindset, and your actions. They all play a part in who you are and friends you keep.  </td>

<td> Chapter 7 talks about being a lifelong learner. 
This is something that we always get confused with as we often mix up formal education and skills. 
Formal education teaches you how to get a job but a learning mindset teaches you how to win at life. You might feel that reading is a chore, however, this is the most powerful learning tool. 
You are reading the thoughts and ideas of people you have been there and done that. When you open your mind to people like that you would start to implement these things into your life. 
A different mindset might just help you to look for solutions to problems from a different perspective and seek the help that you need. But it all starts with you opening your mind to a new train of thought and abstract opinion.
